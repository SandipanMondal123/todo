Full Stack **MERN (MongoDB + Express + ReactJS + NodeJS)** CRUD Todo App that I made. Hope you enjoy! 

I'm currently expanding on this project by adding user authentication and JWT for more security. I am also going to use Redux for state management. 

As a result, I will deploy the app once I finish!

Make sure to add your own **MongoDB connection string** where DB_CONNECT is used in the server.js file in the backend folder!
